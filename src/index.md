# Hi, I'm Minae.

I spun up this page using 11ty for my portfolio. 11ty is a static site generator (SSG) that lets you use various templating, programming, and markup languages to create a website. To deploy the page as a website, I used Netlify.

I write and consult for software documentation projects, and I especially enjoy dealing with modern web technologies. My background in technical education, software development, and applied linguistics means that I can pick up the gist of most software projects quickly. That means you'll need less time to onboard me and explain what npm is, or how to use git, or how CSS works. I'm available for contracts - [email me](mailto:minae.lee@gmail.com) to schedule a 30 minute discovery call. 

## A complete list of technologies used to create this site

- Eleventy (11ty)
- npm CLI
- git CLI
- Netlify
- GitHub
- Markdown
- Nunjucks 
- HTML and CSS
- A code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)) and the bash shell

I've replicated more or less this exact same portfolio page using an array of other technologies, including Astro.js, Docusaurus, ButterCMS, Hugo, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and more. You can find them from [my linktree](https://minaelee.com).

Like all SSGs and other types of web frameworks, it has a build step that takes all the stuff you wrote and creates files that can be interpreted by browsers.

Imagine a funnel. At the wide end of the funnel, code and words written in Markdown, MDX, React, Liquid, vanilla JS and CSS, Tailwind, YAML, JSON, shortcodes, Nunjucks, Handlebars, Vue.js, Pug, Jade, all those front end libraries and frameworks and languagues, get crammed in. But there are (broadly speaking) only three languages that all popular web browsers support: vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Anything that's not written in one of those has to be converted to one of those in order to make it through the funnel. 

That's a part of what web frameworks and SSGs do for you. Why? Because innovation, baby. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS do evolve over time, but slowly. jQuery was a huge deal at one point because JavaScript wasn't able to do a lot of things that jQuery can. Eventually, JavaScript added the same functionalities that jQuery offered, so jQuery is on the decline (though still in heavy use). This is how (web) technologies evolve. People figure out smarter ways to do things that don't fit with the current paradigm. So they use the smarter way to produce results, then create automated solutions to convert those results into the old way of doing things. 

Anyway, I like to see what's going on out in the wild west of web development. I was part of the first generation to learn how to hand-code HTML (in the early '90s, before CSS existed), and I've been around to see everything from the rise and fall of Dreamweaver, FrontPage, and other WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors, to AJAX and Flash, to the dominion of blogging sites out of which WordPress emerged as the victorius CMS, to drag-and-drop site builders like Squarespace, to the current rise of SSGs and headless CMS and cloud deployment services. Honestly, we're at a good place now -- web tech has come a long way, and SSGs are maybe not quite _it_, but it's better than drag-and-drop website builders. We're getting there. -->
